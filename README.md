# Text to Video
Adding text to video to the Blender Video Sequence Editor using ModelScope.

It needs 20 GB of VRAM to run, this and impossible download times, makes me give up this project for now. 

Dunno if this is actually working, I'm still in the process of downloading the 12 GB models...

## How to install
Run Blender as Administrator and open the system console before clicking the Generate Movie button, so you can see how it is progressing the module installation. It'll take a lot of time, since it is a 12GB download.

If some additional python modules are missing, write about it here(so I can add them), and use the Blender PIP add-on to manually install the missing modules: https://github.com/amb/blender_pip

If the weights takes forever to download they can be downloaded here:

Btw. the Blender system console processsing can be stopped with Ctrl + C
