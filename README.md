# Text to Video
Adding text to video to the Blender Video Sequence Editor using ModelScope.

Dunno if this is actually working, I'm still in the process of downloading the 12 GB models...

## How to install
Run Blender as Administrator and open the system console before clicking the Generate Movie button, so you can see how it is progressing.

If some additional modules are missing, write about it here(so I can add them), and use the Blender PIP add-on to manually install the missing modules: https://github.com/amb/blender_pip
